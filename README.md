# Accessible Design Co. Website

This is a simple, project for a company called Accessible Design Co.  
The website is made to be easy to use for everyone and works well on different screen sizes.

## What I did

- Used semantic HTML tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` for good structure.  
- Made a responsive navigation bar with Flexbox.  
- Created a multi-column layout for the services section using CSS Grid.  
- Added a contact form with accessible labels and ARIA attributes.  
- Tested the site on mobile and desktop to make sure it looks good everywhere.  
- Added focus styles for keyboard users and used good color contrast.

## How to see it

1. Download or clone this repo to your computer.  
2. Open the file named `index.html` in a web browser (like Chrome or Firefox).  
3. You can resize the browser window to see how the site changes on smaller screens.


Hope you enjoy my project
